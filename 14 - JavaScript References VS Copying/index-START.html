    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 12;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 15;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // First one is modified, second one is not. Weird.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    console.log(players);

    // Unlike the example above, the modification affects the first and second

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team4[3] = 'Luxx';
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
    }

    console.log(wes)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    console.log(wes, dev)
    dev.name = 'Nick';
    console.log(dev, wes)
